<> Build a browser form which collects Email, Country, Zip Code, Password, Password Confirmation fields

<> It should use live inline validation to inform User whether a field is properly filled in or not, that means highlighting a field red and providing a helpful error message until iit has been filled in properly

<> this form does not need to actually submit, but you should give an error message if OKAY button is PUSHED with any active errors or unfilled required fields

<> if all all is well and form is submitted, that which is error free, give User a High Five

Steps to complete this:
    <> setup an HTML, consider Elements and Validation that will go into them
    <> writeup simplee Fomr Elements
    <> Add Javascript that will check Validation, as User progresses through Form
    <> When a User leaves a Form Field, it should immediately validate that field, rather waiting for OKAY button to be PUSHED
    <> Test out all possible Test Cases
